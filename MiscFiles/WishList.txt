- Fix Ouija Functionality to be multi-channel
- Commenting code.... like a lot
- Make embedded messages on Foyer Copy look nicer (fix fonts, color coding, who deleted if mod, etc)
- Make options command look nicer (and more descriptive as well)
- Make entering options more dynamic (e.g mentioning channel name for channelID, etc)
- Fix Idiom to not give bad results
- Make sure we don't need keep-alive.js
- Turn Github site to dashboard any channel can use (BIG BIG BIG wish, probably overkill)
- Tic Tac Toe (probably per channel, not per user)
- Automated Testing (Groove-only command)
- Update Help command (and make it look prettier)
- Support Markdown/Emoji/Mentions for g!makequote (might not be possible)
- Dictionary command on demand without Tatsumaki + wait (g!define <word> vs t!wiki <word>)
- Look into finding a better way to struncture CommandListener.js (seems sloppy rn)
- Universalize Vote.js (more DB options), also check for code collisions (though unlikely), remove global variables
- Clean up Globals.js, should only be global objects and not hardcoded values (port as new DB options if necessary)
- Bot admins (Groove + others in case this expands)
- Split DB cluster to two production and testing databases (may impact automated testing)
- Revisit "GrooveQuote" uploading to be more abstract (probably won't do this one);
- Foyer Copy welcome message should be channel-editable and abstract
- Tidy up Compliments.js (maybe not init on index.js?)
- Fix code formatting (figure out preferences, go through files to universalize)
